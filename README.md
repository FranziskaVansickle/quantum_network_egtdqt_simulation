# Quantum Network EGT/DQT Simulation

This repository simulates quantum entanglement distribution using two key transduction strategies:  
**Entanglement Generation Transduction (EGT)** and **Direct Quantum Transduction (DQT)**.

The goal is to explore how these transduction strategies affect entanglement fidelity and distribution in a network setting, using ancilla-assisted teleportation and source-destination link modeling. This aligns with emerging challenges in distributed quantum computing and network emulation research.

## What This Project Simulates
- EGT-based generation of hybrid entanglement (using beam splitter models)
- DQT-based entanglement distribution and fidelity loss over noisy channels
- Ancilla qubit-assisted teleportation protocols
- Source-destination link archetypes from quantum networking theory

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer (noisy simulation)
- PennyLane (optional for extension)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for plotting
- NumPy
